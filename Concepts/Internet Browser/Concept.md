<h1>batchOS Beta Module Concept - batchOS Internet Browser</h1>


<h2 id=desc> Description </h2>
batchOS Internet Browser will be build ontop of the stable Google Chrome Search Engine and Application or the Mozilla Firefox
Search Engine and Application.

batchOS Internet Browser would be able to access websites, download files and be able to create
and setup your own presets, for your version and other versions.

The Preset Files would be able to be used with any version of batchOS Internet Browser.
The preset files can be edited, to create your own setup and color schemes, and font style, such as
having the font <font face="Segoe UI"> Segoe UI, which is the default Windows UI Font </font>, or
<font face="Consolas"> Consolas, also known as Monospaced</font>


<h2> Will this be implemented? </h2>

It honestly depends on the stability of later versions of either Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox
